# Agents

Osaurus Agents provide autonomous task execution with built-in issue tracking, planning, and file operations. Use Agents for complex, multi-step tasks that benefit from systematic execution and progress tracking.

---

## Overview

Agents extend Osaurus beyond simple chat interactions. While Chat Mode is ideal for quick questions and single-turn interactions, Work Mode excels at:

- **Multi-step tasks** — Building features, refactoring code, or writing documentation
- **File operations** — Reading, writing, and editing files within a project
- **Systematic execution** — Breaking work into trackable issues with dependencies
- **Parallel workflows** — Running multiple tasks simultaneously

---

## Getting Started

### Accessing Work Mode

1. Open the Chat window
2. Click the **Agent** tab (or use the keyboard shortcut)
3. You'll see the Work Mode interface with the issue tracker sidebar

### Setting a Working Directory

Before starting a task that involves file operations:

1. Click **Select Folder** in the Agent interface
2. Choose the project directory you want to work in
3. Grant folder access when prompted

The working directory determines where file operations can occur. All file paths are relative to this directory.

### Creating Your First Task

1. Type your task description in the input field (e.g., "Add a dark mode toggle to the settings page")
2. Press Enter or click Send
3. The agent will:
   - Analyze your request
   - Create an initial issue
   - Enter the reasoning loop, iteratively calling tools and evaluating progress
   - Complete the task with a summary artifact

## Core Concepts

### Tasks

A **Task** represents a complete unit of work requested by the user. Each task:

- Has a unique identifier
- Contains one or more issues
- Is associated with a agent
- Tracks cumulative token usage

You can run **multiple tasks in parallel**, allowing you to work on different projects or features simultaneously.

### Issues

**Issues** are the building blocks of task execution. Each issue represents a discrete piece of work:

| Property        | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Status**      | `open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `closed`      |
| **Priority**    | P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low) |
| **Type**        | `task`, `bug`, `discovery`                      |
| **Title**       | Brief description of the work                   |
| **Description** | Detailed explanation and context                |
| **Result**      | Outcome after completion                        |

### Reasoning Loop

When working on an issue, the agent enters a **reasoning loop** -- an iterative cycle where the model autonomously decides what to do next:

- Each iteration: the model observes context, reasons about the next action, calls a tool, and evaluates progress
- Loops are bounded to **max 30 iterations** per issue
- The model narrates its thinking and explains actions as it works
- When finished, the model calls `complete_task` to signal completion with a summary

### Dependencies

Issues can have **dependencies** that control execution order:

| Relationship      | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `blocks`          | One issue must complete before another can start |
| `parent_child`    | Child issue created from a parent task            |
| `discovered_from` | Issue was discovered during execution of another |

### Follow-up Issues

During execution, the agent may discover additional work and create **follow-up issues** using the `create_issue` tool:

- **Bugs** — Compilation errors, runtime failures found during execution
- **Related work** — Additional tasks identified while working on the current issue
- **Prerequisites** — Missing dependencies or setup steps

Follow-up issues are automatically tracked in the issue list and linked to the originating issue.

---

## Working Directory (Folder Context)

The working directory provides a sandboxed environment for file operations.

### Project Detection

Osaurus automatically detects your project type based on manifest files:

| Project Type | Detected By                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Swift        | `Package.swift`, `.xcodeproj`, `.xcworkspace`    |
| Node.js      | `package.json`                                   |
| Python       | `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt` |
| Rust         | `Cargo.toml`                                     |
| Go           | `go.mod`                                         |

### Features

- **File tree generation** — Respects project-specific ignore patterns (`.gitignore`, `node_modules`, etc.)
- **Manifest reading** — Understands project structure and dependencies
- **Git integration** — Access to repository status and history
- **Security-scoped bookmarks** — Persistent folder access across sessions

## Features

### Parallel Tasks

Run multiple agent tasks simultaneously:

- Start a new task while others are running
- Each task maintains its own issue list and execution state
- Background tasks continue running independently
- View all active tasks in the sidebar

### File Operation Logging

Every file operation is logged for transparency and reversibility:

- **Create** — New file created
- **Write** — File contents replaced
- **Edit** — Specific text replaced
- **Delete** — File removed
- **Move** — File relocated
- **Copy** — File duplicated

Use the **Undo** feature to revert individual operations or all changes for an issue.

### Background Execution

Tasks continue running even when:

- The Agent window is closed
- You switch to Chat Mode
- Osaurus is minimized

Background task progress appears in:

- Toast notifications
- Activity feed
- Menu bar indicators

### Clarification Requests

When a task is ambiguous, the agent pauses to ask for clarification:

- Questions appear in the chat interface
- May include predefined options for quick selection
- Execution resumes after you respond

### Token Usage Tracking

Monitor resource consumption per task:

- **Input tokens** — Context sent to the model
- **Output tokens** — Generated responses
- **Cumulative total** — Running count across all issues

---

## Integration

### Agents

Each task is associated with a **agent**:

- The active agent when you start a task is used throughout
- Agent's system prompt guides the agent's behavior

### Skills & Methods

Capabilities are automatically selected via **preflight RAG search**:

- Before each agent loop, Osaurus searches indexed skills, methods, and tools using the task context
- Relevant skill instructions and method workflows are injected into the system prompt
- Matching tool definitions are merged into the active tool set
- The agent can dynamically discover and load additional capabilities at runtime via `capabilities_search` and `capabilities_load`
- Successful tool-call sequences can be saved as methods via `methods_save` for reuse in future tasks

| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `open`        | `in_progress` | Agent starts working on issue |
| `in_progress` | `blocked`     | Dependency not yet resolved   |
| `in_progress` | `closed`      | Issue completed successfully  |
| `blocked`     | `in_progress` | Blocking issue resolved       |
| Any           | `closed`      | User manually closes issue    |

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Task Descriptions

- **Be specific** — "Add a logout button to the navbar" vs "Update the UI"
- **Provide context** — Mention relevant files, frameworks, or patterns
- **Define success** — Describe the expected outcome

### Managing Multiple Tasks

- Use different working directories for unrelated projects
- Review task progress regularly in the sidebar
- Cancel stuck tasks and retry with clearer instructions

### Handling Clarifications

- Answer promptly to avoid blocking execution
- Choose from predefined options when available
- Provide additional context if the question is unclear

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Can't Access Files

- Verify the working directory is set correctly
- Check that folder permissions were granted
- Ensure the file path is within the working directory

### Task Seems Stuck

- Check for pending clarification requests
- Review the issue status in the sidebar
- Look for blocked dependencies

### Unexpected File Changes

- Use the file operation log to review changes
- Undo specific operations or all changes for an issue
- Check git status for uncommitted modifications
